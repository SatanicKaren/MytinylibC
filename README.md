# MytinylibC
This repo contains my own Standard C library.

- I want to code standard library from scratch but it's not going to be just a code practicing...

- I start with coding a tiny and minimal form of string.h, ctype.h, stdlib.h and stdio.h .
  these 4 header files would have the basic functions and I will advance as far as i need.

- first goals:
    string.h:
      strlen, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strcmp, strncmp, memset, memcpy, memmove, memcmp
    ctype.h:
      isalpha, isdigit, isspace, toupper, tolower
    stdlib.h:
      itoa, utoa, atoi, rand, abs
    stdio.h:
      putchar, puts, printf
  then I'll advance...

- Any help at any levels to make improvements... I would be glad.
